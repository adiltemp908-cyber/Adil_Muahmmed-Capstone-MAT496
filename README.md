## Reason for Picking Up This Project

The reason of doing this is because I believe I will have the option to use almost everything I learned throughout the course for this goal. I will have human in the loop dictate what news categories I want to see, then lets say the user choose sports and stocks then I will have web search on both topics parallely. Then convert the retrieved documents to use semantic search and rag application. Then building the nodes and graph we cover and implement almost all the topics throughout the course.
